# Coronary Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using machine learning models on the Framingham Heart Study dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature analysis, and model training using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, missing values, and feature correlations
- Preprocessing to handle missing data and imbalanced target classes
- Training and tuning multiple machine learning models
- Evaluating models using standard classification metrics

## Features

- Uses the Framingham Heart Study dataset for CHD prediction
- Handles imbalanced datasets using suitable preprocessing techniques
- Implements and compares multiple models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Discusses feature correlations and potential multicollinearity

## How to Run

This notebook is intended for use with **Google Colab**:

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Ensure required libraries (`pandas`, `sklearn`, `xgboost`, etc.) are available
3. Run all cells sequentially to execute the analysis

## Output

- Model performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
- Feature correlation heatmaps and interpretation
- Comparison of model effectiveness in handling imbalanced CHD prediction
